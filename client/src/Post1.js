          It's dead week, and the pressure is on. Finals are just around the
          corner, and I'm feeling the weight of all the material I have to
          cover. It's tough going through my notes and lectures on embedded
          systems for CPRE 288. I can't help but feel overwhelmed.
          <br />
          But I remind
          myself that I'm almost done. I've made it through the entire semester
          and learned so much already. I need to trust in my abilities and
          believe that I can do this.
          <br />
          I'm trying my best to take breaks and take
          care of myself during this hectic time. Getting enough sleep, eating
          healthily, and exercising are crucial to staying focused and retaining
          information. It may sound like cliches, but they really do make a
          difference. I also need to remember to be kind to myself. It's okay to
          struggle or feel overwhelmed - everyone does at some point. But I need
          to remind myself of all the hard work I've put in so far and how close
          I am to the finish line. 
          <br />So I'll keep pushing through, stay focused,
          and take care of myself. I know I can do this, and I'm looking forward
          to finishing strong.
