          I've been going through STAT 330 this semester, and it's been an
          increasingly difficult course. As a statistics course designed for
          computer science, it's been challenging to keep up with the material.
          I've spent countless hours studying and working on assignments, but it
          still feels like I'm struggling to grasp some of the concepts.
          <br />
          What's made it even harder is the lack of resources available to me. I
          often feel like I'm on my own in trying to figure out the material.
          I've tried reaching out to my professor and classmates for help, but
          it still feels like I'm falling behind.
          <br />
          Despite these issues, I'm determined to overcome them and ace the
          final. I know that the topics I'm learning now are essential to my
          academic journey. I hope to utilize these skills later in the
          workforce, and I can't afford to let this course bring me down.
          <br />
          I'm trying to focus on the positives and remind myself of my goals.
          I've come this far, and I can't give up now. I need to keep pushing
          through and taking the time to fully understand the material.
          <br />
          I'm also trying to make the most of the resources available to me.
          I've been attending office hours, reaching out to classmates for study
          sessions, and even looking for additional resources online. It's not
          ideal, but it's all I can do to make sure I'm fully prepared for the
          final.
          <br />
          It's a tough journey, but I know that I'm capable of succeeding if I
          put in the effort. I just need to keep pushing through and staying
          determined.
