          It's been a challenging semester studying Com S 327. I've spent
          countless hours learning the ins and outs of C and C++, and working on
          a clone of Pokemon, all drawn in ASCII art. It's been a lot of work,
          but also incredibly rewarding to see my project come together.
          <br />
          Now that the project is complete, I'm faced with the final exam, which
          covers all depths of the C and C++ languages. It's a daunting task to
          review and remember everything I've learned over the course of the
          semester.
          <br />
          But I know that I'm capable of doing well on this exam. I've put in
          the time and effort to understand the material, and I'm proud of the
          work I've done throughout the semester. I need to stay focused and
          continue to put in the effort to study.
          <br />
          At the same time, I need to make sure I'm taking breaks and taking
          care of myself. It's easy to get caught up in the stress of finals
          week and neglect self-care. But getting enough sleep, eating
          healthily, and exercising will help me stay focused and perform at my
          best.
          <br />
          I'm feeling a mix of emotions as the semester comes to a close. I'm
          excited to see what the future holds, but I'm also a bit sad to say
          goodbye to this chapter of my education. But for now, I need to focus
          on finishing strong and doing my best on this final exam.
