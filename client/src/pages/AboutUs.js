        "description": "Hello my name is Kayley Clark, I came to Iowa State in the Fall of 2021 as an Industrial Engineering major. After discovering my passion for programming, I decided to switch into Software Engineering.  Throughout my journey at Iowa State, I have seen anywhere from cyber security to data structures to front end development. To me, COM S 319 is the first class I have seen a full stack development come together, from the backend of raspberry piâ€™s to the front end webpage design.",

        "description": "Hello my name is Manas Mathur, I'm currently an undergraduate student enrolled in their sophomore year of Computer Science. Technology has always fascinated me while growing up; seeing how far tech can evolve to enhance our lives will never cease to amaze me. I believe that the future of technology lies in finding innovative ways to make information more accessible and engaging to people, and web development is at the forefront of that movement. I hope to contribute to the growth fo technology as a whole, and through COM S 319 I will further gain the education to do so.",

        "description": "Hello my name is Melani Hodge, I am currently studying Software Engineering at Iowa State University. When I came to Iowa State, I was undecided engineering. With both my dad and brother working in technology, I was familiar with the field and was unimpressed. My intro to engineering class freshmen year changed that. In that class, I was introduced to VBA. Since then, I have learned Python, Java, JavaScript, React, RTL, and more. With technology, the field is always changing, and the opportunities are endless. COM S 319 has introduced me to combining the languages into making a functioning webpage like this one.",
